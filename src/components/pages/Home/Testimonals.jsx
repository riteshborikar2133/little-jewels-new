            I am very happy with my choice of school for Anshika. I feel proud as a father to see the emerging talents in my daughter. I would like to thank all the teachers for their hardwork & constant dedication to keep parents updated & informed during these challenging times. 
Strong leadership is the foundation of a school's success & without the Sr. Principal, Mrs. Anmol Badjatia Ma'am it would not been possible.                  
We feel proud & fortunate to have Anmol Ma'am as the Sr. Principal of the school.  Maâ€™am has balanced the school so well during these rapidly changing times.
Thanks to "Little Jewels" for providing a great learning system to all the students.
